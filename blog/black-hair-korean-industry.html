    It was not too long ago that black hair products could only be found in
    particular neighborhoods. I remember a time when weaves and wigs were
    generally silky and straight, but when you think about the modern day weave
    or wig the options are endless. These days artificial hair can emulate
    anything, from an Afro to locs to big curly hair. The hair industry has
    evolved over the years, and you really can find whatever your heart
    desires. I for one have gone down a social media rabbit hole of
    before-and-after hair transformations because the possibilities are
    endless. Nielsen’s
    <a

    >
        report
    </a>
    on black consumer behavior found that black people account for 85.65% of
    the $63.5 million that was spent on ethnic hair and beauty aids last year-
    that’s a whopping $54.5 million. As a black consumer I do not find this to
    be particularly surprising, but it is absolutely noteworthy. It is
    especially remarkable when you consider that according to the
    <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI225217#viewtop">
        U.S Census Bureau
    </a>
    black people account for only 14% of the U.S population. If you want to
    talk about consumer power, this definitely seems like a place to start.
</p>
<p>
    Black consumers dominate when it comes to spending on ethnic hair and
    beauty aids. Based on these numbers, we are influencers in the market. It
    is not just about the amount we are spending but additionally, we add what
    Nielsen describes as a “cool factor”. Black people tend to set trends that
    then attract mainstream consumers, as can be seen in
    <a href="http://www.crresearch.com/black-history-month-pop-culture">
        findings
    </a>
    by the marketing research company C+R Research. This might not be news to
    the black consumer, but it is yet another statement that deems us as
    influencers. All this said however, there are multiple factors that we as
    black consumers and influencers should consider. Last April Minnesota
    Public Radio (MPR) published an
    <a
        href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/25/black-beauty-shops-korean-suppliers-roots-of-tension-mn"
    >
        interview article
    </a>
    featuring black entrepreneurs who are struggling to penetrate this
    multibillion-dollar industry. The article highlights issues that challenge
    black business owners who are trying to join the lucrative industry. With
    Korean Americans owning over 70% of the beauty supply stores in the entire
    country, it is an uphill battle for newcomers especially.
</p>
<p>
    Koreans are not new to the hair industry. As a black business owner
    mentions in the MPR interview, Korean Americans saw the business
    opportunity as far back as the 80’s and 90’s when extension hairstyles were
    popular, and no one was interested in moving to black neighborhoods. While
    box-braids were trending, think Janet in Poetic Justice, as business owners
    on MPR explain, Korean Americans were building ethnic hair businesses that
    have become dynasties. According to their testimonies, some of the
    challenges faced by new business owners and old-timers alike include;
    language barriers, being denied supplies, high minimum order requirements,
    and other competitive restrictions. Fair or not, Korean Americans entered
    the game early and they used this advantage to build their communities by
    working together. All ethical practice and morals aside, one could argue
    that Korean Americans simply made a good business decision.
</p>
<p>
    By supporting each other, Korean Americans have taken over the ethnic hair
    industry and black people have everything to do with it. Black people have
    a complex relationship with hair thanks to the lingering aftermath of
    slavery, racism, and colonialism. Conversations like good hair versus bad
    hair, or professional hair versus unprofessional hair have often been the
    subjects of passionate debate. Hair is important to us as is often
    expressed through our music and literature, our unique and intricate
    hairstyles, and clearly in the amount of money we spend on hair care. Even
    though we account for a whopping 85.65% of the total spending in this
    industry, that number does not mean much if black business owners are
    beings held back while Korean Americans build wealth with our dollars. What
    would it mean for black people to use our influence as consumers to build
    our businesses and communities? Our dollars and influence are supporting an
    industry that does not welcome us, and so I think it is safe to say that it
    is our responsibility to explore our options and figure out how we can use
    our consumer power to our advantage.
