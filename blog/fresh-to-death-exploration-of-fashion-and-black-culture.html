    My mother always insisted I try on these frilly, puffed sleeved, and pastel
    colored dresses, so that I had nice things for church. She’d look
    disdainfully down at my scribbled on beloved Chuck Taylor’s. You know the
    ones my friends and I drew all over when we were bored during class. She
    insisted if I ever wore those “ratty sneakers” to church I’d be the talk of
    the congregation… I will say, in hindsight I recognize this was probably a
    gimmick. Surely these people had better things to do like, I don’t know,
    worship… But, ultimately her desire for me to look nice on Sundays isn’t
    uncharacteristic of Black Christian life and is synonymous to wearing your
    “Sunday’s best”.
</p>
<p>
    Looking back at my experience growing up in the church, it would be
    impossible to disconnect fashion to worship. I loved seeing the myriad of
    colors and designs of the men’s suits and women’s skirts and the unspoken
    hat competition (Ms. Betty, an 85 year old widow always wore it best).
    Everyone wanted to shine in the eyes of the lord and convey to believers
    and non-believers the “gifts” the Lord bestows on us. The preacher’s wife
    was the trendsetter and “queen of the church”. Key takeaway… looking sharp
    was important. But, as we all know, looking “fly” in Black culture isn’t
    just isolated to Sundays. Recall how important clothing is at every level
    of public schooling.

    My brother told me he dropped hundreds of dollars on a limited edition Nike
    collab sneaker, after he earned his first paycheck. I was flabbergasted
    that he would spend all this money on a basketball sneaker that was “too
    nice” to wear on the courts or outside. To him the sneaker represented so
    much more than casual, wearable, athletic sneakers. It was a status symbol
    and one that brought him closer to “the dream”.
</p>
<p>
    The documentary “Fresh Dressed” directed and written by Sacha Jenkins
    explores the birth of urban fashion through the lens of hip hop and
    corporate America. In the film Swizz Beatz recollects, “that having fresh
    clean sneakers spoke to the wealth that you didn’t have but wanted” (Fresh
    Dressed, 2015). For Beatz, “color-coordinated” and well kept “clean crisp
    sneakers” spoke to the dignity of the wearer who meticulously selected his
    clothing and wore and treated them with pride. The crude reality for many
    Blacks growing up in the United States meant the absence of equality,
    opportunity, generational wealth creation, and money. Clothing and fashion
    has always had a transformative power. Carl Banks says, “Hip hop fashion
    was derived through the music and it was kind of a ‘we’re not gonna follow
    the rules’ mentality both in rap music and in fashion” (Fresh Dressed,
    2015).

    This article series works to understand the weight of the Black dollars
    when it comes to the athletic sportswears industry by exploring the
    emerging of hip hop culture to fashion and how this was in turn
    commercialized. In the wake of Serena Williams’ catsuit being banned at the
    French Open and Nike shares falling amid backlash over featuring Colin
    Kaepernick, the reach of Black activism and how it can influences spend in
    this category is clear.
