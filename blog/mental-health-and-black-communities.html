<p>
    The thing about Mental Illness is that it does not always manifest through
    symptoms that can be measured or observed. Mental illness can be defined as
    a condition that affects thinking, feeling, and/or behavior. While these
    are things that cannot really be seen, I think it is safe to say that we
    have all experienced negative thoughts and emotions, and we know them to be
    real. According to the
    <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml">
        National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),
    </a>
    almost 1 in 5 adults in the U.S live with a
</p>
<p>
    mental illness. NIMH estimates that this year alone, over 6.8 black
    Americans have been diagnosed with a mental illness.
</p>
<p>
    When it comes to the black community, there are several things that make a
    challenging issue even more problematic. Firstly, there is the issue of
    acknowledging and understanding that mental health is a legitimate, and
    treatable, condition. In the same way that one cannot simply will away a
    physical illness, mental illness is something that should be dealt with the
    help of a mental health professional. I have often heard people suggest
    that a condition like depression, for
</p>
<p>
    example, is something one can just get over and push through. Resilience is
    a great quality, and it can certainly serve as a tool to get through a
    difficult situation, but it is not a treatment plan. I have heard, on
    multiple occasions, this notion that certain illnesses or disorders do not
    affect black people; like eating disorders for example. This is simply not
    true and it is a mentality that needs to change.
</p>
<p>
    On a day-to-day basis, many black people are dealing with systemic and
    personal racism, microaggressions, as well as poverty and all the
    consequences of it. For instance, as stated by the
    <a
        href="https://www.nami.org/find-support/diverse-communities/african-americans"
    >
        National Alliance for Mental Health
    </a>
    , black children are more likely to be exposed to violence,
</p>
<p>
    and black people account for about 40% of the homeless population. The
    department of
    <a
        href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;amp;lvlid=24"
    >
        Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health
    </a>
    further emphasizes this fact in stating that Black Americans are 20 percent
    more likely to report serious psychological distress when compared to
    whites. Several factors increase the risk of developing mental illness
    among black Americans, but what is especially troubling about this is the
    fact that as a community, we are less likely to address mental health.
</p>
<p>
    There is a stigma that exists in the black community such that mental
    illness is often viewed as suggesting that one is crazy or weak, or perhaps
    as something that can be endured or be addressed privately. In recent years
    various celebrities like Kid Cudi, Mariah Carey, and Gucci Mane have worked
    to normalize mental illness by talking about their struggles. Earlier this
    year in an interview with CNN, as described
    <a
        href="https://www.refinery29.com/2018/01/189292/jay-z-interview-mental-health-masculinity-therapy"
    >
        here
    </a>
    by Refinery29, Jay-Z talked about his own struggles and the need to
    eliminate the mental health stigma in black communities. Slowly but surely
    we are becoming more open about mental health, but we still have work to
    do. We must continue to educated ourselves, talk openly about our
    struggles, and seek help. In order to promote mental health and wellness,
    we must work to destigmatize mental illness.
</p>
<p>
    Seeking help through a mental health professional does not mean that you
    must abandon the resources within your community. There is room for your
    values and cultural beliefs within the context of therapy. One of the
    challenges black people face in treatment is the lack of Black/African
    American practitioners within the field. American Psychological Association
    (APA) reports that Black/African Americans represent only 5.3% of the
    psychology workforce while white people account for almost 84%. This means
    that often times the people offering services are white and that can be
    difficult for black patients in many ways. On a positive note, the APA also
    reports that the number of black therapists continues to grow, but in the
    meantime black people should not be afraid to seek help.
</p>
<p>
    Finding a therapist can be a tough. You must find the right fit all the
    while being vulnerable, and sometimes that requires a process of trial and
    error. One of the ways to tackle this problem is to seek a culturally
    competent practitioner. Do not be afraid to ask questions related to
    racial, cultural, and even class differences in order to gauge whether or
    not you will be heard and understood. A good therapist, regardless of race,
    should be both respectful and curious about your cultural beliefs and
    values. There are several efforts that have yet to be made in order to make
    treatment accessible and affordable for people of color, but in the
    meantime we can start by working to normalize mental illness. In doing so
    we prevent further health complications, while also improving the way we
    function and engage with the world on a daily basis.
