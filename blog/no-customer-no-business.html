										<h2>No Customer No Business</h2>
									</section>
									<section>
						<p>
    With great success comes great sacrifice, and no person who commits to
    establishing their own enterprise is exempt from this fact. Edmon
    Braithwaite, the owner of Nostrand Wines &amp; Spirits, is familiar with
    the truth of this statement. The Guyanese wine connoisseur sat down with us
    and took us on the journey of his life, recounting the highs when he first
    launched his wine shop following a friend’s suggestion, to the lows when he
    found himself diverting profits into a side hustle that almost destroyed
    everything. One principle that stuck with him throughout was the
    satisfaction of his customers. In fact, “no customer, no business,” is the
    mantra that guided Edmon through it all.

    Born and raised in Guyana, a small country in the Caribbean known as “the
    land of many waters”, Edmon moved to the United States after training in
    the British military and serving in the Guyanese Army. His management
    skills at a national office supply chain caught the attention of a
    colleague, who suggested he go into business for himself. He applied and
    received his liquor license, and shortly thereafter, Nostrand Wines and
    Spirits was born. Establishing his budding store on the corner of Nostrand
    and Atlantic, business began to boom and thus commenced his introduction to
    the Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. Over the next
    few years, Edmon saw his customers go from 90% Black, mostly local
    residents, to less than 50% Black. Many patrons were from Scandinavia,
    Asia, or Latin America. Thankfully, just before the 2008 recession, Edmon
    purchased a nearby building, from which he manages the shop to this day.
    During this time, Edmon and a long-time local businessman also founded the
    Bedford Stuyvesant Business District to promote local and minority
    entrepreneurship. Edmon served as the first chairman of its board of
    directors.

    Edmon later decided to help spearhead “One Caribbean Radio,” a new radio
    station and passion project giving voice to a disjointed and
    disenfranchised Caribbean community. For almost 7 years he juggled a
    family, a thriving wine business, and a radio station. Edmon soon found
    himself diverting all of the revenues from the wine store into the radio
    station. Despite the need to grow the wine business, Edmon rationalized his
    determination to pour back into the community that had given him so much.
    The station was even recognized by the Clinton Foundation as a critical
    element within the local business community’s development. But when the
    Great Recession hit, the station did not survive. This was a huge setback
    for Edmon, not only because the station failed, but because the revenue
    diversion almost took the wine shop too. Edmon lost almost two million
    dollars in investments during this period. “There were many customers that
    would come in and would ask, ‘What’s going on? I see nothing on the
    shelves...what can we do to help?’ My customers saw me- there was just
    nothing to sell.” One of the hardest periods in his life, this was a major
    loss for his entire family.
</p>
<p>
    Asked how he kept going, Edmon says he leaned on the words of his father:
    “Regardless of the obstacle, you are going to overcome it.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    He recalls the early mornings, late nights, missing dinner, the IRS on his
    back, his customers. Edmon’s wife held down the fort at home. Edmon admits
    that “when you own your own business, with the level of commitment that you
    have to have, there are certain parts of your life that are obviously going
    to suffer,” alluding to his marriage and the toll that it has taken on his
    family. It was important for Edmon to lean on the values instilled during
    his childhood, because “when you’re in that stage, lots of things go
    through your mind,” Edmon reflected, alluding to sometimes dangerous
    thoughts. It took Edmon six years to recover from the economic downturn
    that shook the world.
</p>
<p>
    Thankfully, Edmon bounced back from these difficult times. He carefully
    catered to the needs of the support system that frequented his place of
    business: his customers. “There’s no single answer to how you
    recover...it’s all about how you treat people.” From the beginning, Edmon
    has made customer satisfaction a focal point in operating a great business.
    The personal and professional connections he developed with his longtime
    customers would be the secret weapon he never anticipated he would need.
    That and a stable life at home, largely thanks to Mrs. Braithewaite.
    Without her, it would have all fallen apart. “She would be shocked to hear
    me say what I’m saying now,” Edmon said with a chuckle.

    All of the sacrifices were worth it because the wine shop played a direct
    role in Edmon’s ability to provide for his family. His children- an
    accountant, an engineer and daughter in medical school- are doing
    exceptionally well. Edmon can look at his children and smile at the
    results. He only hopes that as they navigate life and careers as young
    adults, that they come to understand his sacrifices and can see life
    through his eyes.
</p>
<p>
    Last November Edmon celebrated his 11th annual Toast of Brooklyn Food and
    Wine Festival, which took place in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He presented
    over 100 fine wines and liquors, and hosted more than twenty food vendors
    that fed the many palettes traveling from near and far. Toast of Brooklyn
    is packed with up and coming food and drink brands as well as live food
    demonstrations you won’t experience anywhere else. Nostrand Wines and
    Liquors is where it all began.
