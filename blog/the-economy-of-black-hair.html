    It’s no secret that a Black woman’s hair is her crown- playing Solange
    Knowle’s “Don’t Touch my Hair” on repeat while “yaass” girling every Yara
    Shahidi hairstyle in “Grownish” (ABC, 2018). We dreadlock, twist, braid,
    Afro, curl, and coil our strands, or sometimes we rock a good weave or wig.
    I know, you’re wondering what’s more powerful than hair that defies
    gravity? And yet, when it comes to our hair, everybody and their
    grandmothers have opinions on how we should “keep” our hair – as if it ever
    needed to be “kept”.
</p>

<p>
    As a young girl I struggled with hair identity. I remember going to Ms.
    Ethel’s cash only salon, where numbered pictures lined the walls depicting
    girls wearing sleekly pressed, curled, primped and set hairstyles. No less
    than five seconds after plopping down into her leather chair would she say,
    “You’re seven minutes late girl, what you want today?” This one time stands
    out to me. It was a last minute appointment I begged my mother to make
    after finding out that I’d be getting a makeover at a friend’s slumber
    party. The other girls invited had straight hair and I didn’t want my
    friend’s mom to be confused when it was my turn. My hair had quite the
    track record for being difficult – commonly measured by the number of combs
    you’ve broken (answer: too many to count). A visit to the hairdresser meant
    fighting the impulse to squirm under the heat of the hot comb and holding
    still even while smelling burnt hair and oil.
</p>

<p>
    As I got older I started questioning why I felt the need to go to the salon
    every week for a fresh blowout. And why every corner beauty store, even the
    ones in predominantly Black communities, were Asian owned? It seemed like
    everyone was profiting off of my hair, except the Black community and me.
    So how did Koreans come to dominate the commercial Black hair industry in
    the US?
</p>

<p>
    We all know that one of the most expensive products in beauty supply stores
    is the hair- ranging from synthetic mixture to virgin human hair. In South
    Korea during the 1960s the wig industry was booming. It was doing so well
    that a conglomerate of wig merchants petitioned the government to outlaw
    the export of raw hair “ma[king] it so that one can only buy the pre-made
    wigs and extensions” (Aron Ranen). Essentially, this meant Korea hair could
    only be manufactured in Korea. Following this trade ban the USA, in the
    spirit of anti-communism, initiated a ban of its own which prevented the
    import of wigs with hair from China. This left Korean businessmen and
    manufacturers in the perfect predicament to corner the wig industry and
    later roll out distribution to cover other styling needs.
</p>

<p>
    Black women today, whether relaxed, natural, and every stage in between,
    are more conscientious about what they put in their hair. If we look at the
    past ten years, relaxer sales sharply declined and gave rise to the
    “natural” hair movement. The industry was completely caught off guard and
    we saw the emergence of home grown Black brands like Carol’s Daughter and
    Shea Moisture. Now, we see a resurgence of relaxers, but amongst consumers
    that are more informed and demand their needs to be met. The opportunity is
    clear. Who knows better how to cater to Black women then Black women? Isn’t
    it about time we started profiting off of our own coils, locks, twists,
    naps, and curls?
